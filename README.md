# How To Compile

1. Download both device tree and vendor tree and extract them to device/tecno/w2 and vendor/tecno/w2 respectively.
  or cd to your working directory. To do that, simply create a local_manifest.xml to ```sourcedir/.repo/local_manifests```
  Note that , by default ``local_manifest``` directory is not available to you must create it yourself.
  so :
  ```
     $ cd .repo && mkdir local_manifests
     $ cd local_manifests
     $ > local_manifest.xml && nano local_manifest.xml
  ```
  then copy to paste this in the nano page :
 ```xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <manifest>
         <project path="device/tecno/w2" name="OS2mt6580/android_device_tecno_w2" remote="github" revision="master"/>

         <project path="vendor/tecno/w2" name="OS2mt6580/android_vendor_tecno_w2" remote="github" revision="master"/>

 </manifest>
  ```
  as you use ```ctrl+x``` to save.
   | now back to sourcedir, then use : ```repo sync --force-sync``` to resync


  # OR


```
https://github.com/OS2mt6580/android_device_tecno_w2.git -b master  device/tecno/w2
```
```
https://github.com/OS2mt6580/android_vendor_tecno_w2.git -b master vendor/tecno/w2
```

# TO START BUILD :::


# you have to/must patch your MTK to meet boot up requirements :)

if you want to check the patch then use :
```
chmod 755 ./device/tecno/w2/patches/check.sh
./device/tecno/w2/patches/check.sh
```

```
chmod 755 ./device/tecno/w2/patches/apply.sh
./device/tecno/w2/patches/apply.sh
```


*Now ==>*

 1. $ ```. build/envsetup.sh```
 2. $ ```lunch```
  and select your device from menu [select ```lineage_w2-userdebug```]
  
   *Tip* : *simply type ```lunch lineage_w2-userdebug``` lunch it*

 3. brunch w2 [for Lineage Based]
  # Example *: ```brunch w2```    [ this for LOS ]*

 4.  It will take time to compile your build
 5. Find your build in $out directory
 6. Enjoy
